Web scraping using Beautiful Soup 


### Scraping data
Objective: Analyze the ratings of the code academies from the webpage switchup.org
 To do this, we’ll first scrape data from switchup.org. It’s essential to identify the goal of our scraping right from the beginning. Writing a scraping script can take a lot of time, especially if we want to scrape more than one web page. We want to avoid spending hours writing a script which scrapes data we won’t actually need.

### Working out which pages to scrape

main_url = 'https://www.switchup.org'
url_berlin = 'https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-bootcamps-berlin'
